  <!-- To create the residual plots, we'll explore model 2. We need to create three plots. The y axes for each plot will be the residuals (the observed life expectancy - the life expectancy predicted by our model). The x axis for our three plots will be GDP Per Capita, year, and our predicted values.  -->

<!-- We will need to crete the residuals to execute these plots. We can do this as the code below specifies. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- predictions = predict.lm(object = model2, newdata = gapminder) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can easily add these predictions to our tibble for plotting with the tools we've previously learned. Furthermore, we can calculate the redisuals in the next step. -->
  
  <!-- ```{r} -->
  <!-- gapminder_predicted = gapminder %>% -->
    <!--  mutate(Fitted = predictions) %>% -->
    <!--  mutate(residual = lifeExp - predictions) -->
    <!-- head(gapminder_predicted) -->
    <!-- ``` -->
    
    <!-- Now we can use `ggplot` to create the three residual plots. -->
    
    <!-- ```{r} -->
    <!-- gapminder_predicted %>% -->
    <!--  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = residual)) + -->

    <!-- ```{r} -->

    <!-- We can see from the residual plots, that our model stands up well to consistant variance, however, linearity and normality of errors are suspect. Lets apply a simple transformation to our model and see if it improves our residuals. -->

      <!-- We'll now re-run the same code as before and look at the change to our residuals to see how our change impacts our assumptions. -->

<!-- It appears that the consistancy of variance assumption is satisfied, however, the normality of errors is still a little suspect. -->


<!-- One of the more common statistical tools students learn in Econometrics is Simple Linear Regression. It happens to be one of many tools in R's arsonel.  -->
      
      <!-- Using the `parsnip` package from the `tidymodels` family of packages, we can easily create a linear model and extract the regression coefficience and P Values.  -->
      
      <!-- To begin, install the `parsnip` and `broom` packages, if not already installed: -->
      
      <!-- ```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE} -->
      <!-- install.packages("parsnip") -->
      <!-- install.packages("broom") -->
      <!-- ``` -->
      
      <!-- In the example below, students can easily learn to do the following: -->
      
      <!-- 1) Specify the model type: In this instance, we specify linear regression with the `linear_reg()` fuction. -->
  <!-- 2) Specify the engine: In the `set_engine` function we specify the computational engine. In this instance, we are using the linear regression function from R's base stats package.  -->
<!-- 3) Specify the 'fit' of the model: In this case, we regress `lifeExp` on `gdpPercap`. -->
<!-- 4) Request the the summary of the model using the `tidy` command.  -->

<!-- Note, we add the `kable` functions to improve the layout style of the output. -->

<!-- ```{r, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE} -->
<!-- library(parsnip) -->
<!-- library(broom) -->

<!-- linear_reg() %>% -->
<!--  set_engine("lm") %>% -->
<!--  fit(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder) %>% -->
<!--  tidy() %>% -->
<!--  kableExtra::kable() %>% -->
<!--  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- For more information about `parship` see the project web site: https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/ -->

<!-- so we need more here.... obviously -->

<!-- ## An example of how to cite in R -->


<!-- With more than 275 practical recipes, this expanded edition [@teetor_long] helps you perform data analysis with R quickly and efficiently. The R language [@R-rmarkdown;@R-knitr] provides everything you need to do statistical work, but its structure can be difficult to master. These task-oriented recipes make you productive with R immediately. Solutions range from basic tasks to input and output, general statistics, graphics, and linear regression. -->

<!-- Each recipe addresses a specific problem and includes a discussion that explains the solution and provides insight into how it works. If you're a beginner, R Cookbook will help get you started. If you're an intermediate user, this book will jog your memory and expand your horizons @grolemund_wickham. You'll get the job done faster and learn more about R in the process. -->
  
  
  
  
  <!-- #### R Studio Layout -->
  
  <!-- One of the most common mistakes I run into in class on day one is for beginners to try to run R directly from the console. They have R Studio downloaded, but do not understand the difference between R and R studio. R is the program that executes all commands you provide. It is the engine of the car, if you will. R Studio is the shell that keeps the user organized. R Studio is the shell around the car. To continue, it is the steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, and seatbelts.  -->
  
  <!-- To ensure you have opened R Studio, you screen should be broken into 3 to 4 panels.  -->
  
  <!-- 1) Top Right: The Environment -->
  <!-- 2) Bottom Right: The Files Viewer (what do you call this quadrants?) -->
  <!-- 3) Bottom Right: The Console -->
  <!-- 4) Top Left: The Script -->
  
  <!-- Upon first opening R Studio, you may not have panel 4. In order to open up a script, you will need to select `file` -> `New File` -> `R Script`. -->
  
  <!-- Many new users also make the mistke of not realizing that they have not opened up a script. They begin executing in the console again and do not take advantage of the ease that scripts provide in writing reproducable code.  -->
  
  <!-- Possibly note on how to execute lines of code. Both code chuncks and specific lines of code. -->

<!-- When teaching, is the intent to teach coding in R, or is it to use R as an aide to teach statistics? This will drive what you do and why you do it.  -->

<!-- ### What is the intent of teaching with R? -->

<!-- I have taught advanced introduction to probability and statistics and used R as a tool to teach statistics. We introduced it by showing how it can be a good calculator -- and along the way taught some of the R Studio functionality (projects/setting working directory, how to execute lines of code, save variables, etc). -->

<!-- I have also taught sabermetrics where we taught coding in R. So we needed to do data analysis (and we worked under the assumptions that our cadets knew basic statistics) so I taught the coding as a means of data analysis. -->

<!-- ### Do you "give stutents code"? -->

<!-- You have two options: -->

<!-- 1) Give students code before class.  -->

<!-- The advantage here is that you can talk concepts and the syntax and inevitable mistyping, etc does not inhibit the larger purpose of the instruction.  -->

<!-- The disadvantage is that students don't get intimate with the coding process and learn the necessary skill of trial and error.  -->
  
  <!-- 2) Don't give them code and expect them to keep up.  -->

<!-- The advantage is that cadets are learning the process of coding and "own" the code while they write it.  -->

<!-- The disadvantage is instead of teaching concepts, students are distracted by keeping up with the coding and missing out on the statistics lesson -->

<!-- My recommendation -- you give code if your intent is teaching statistics. You don't give code if the intent is that cadets learn to code.  -->
